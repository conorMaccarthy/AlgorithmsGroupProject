This program implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine optimal routing on a weighted, undirected graph. The program reads from a text file and creates a graph based on it. The program will prompt the user to enter a node and will then output the optimal paths from several pre-defined key nodes (Charging Stations) to the input node. The program will deduce which one is the closest and will recommend it to the user.
